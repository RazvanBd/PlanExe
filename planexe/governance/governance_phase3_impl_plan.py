Governance Implementation Plan - How to set it up.

Define the specific, sequential steps needed to actually set up and operationalize the internal governance bodies. 
This includes actions like drafting/approving Terms of Reference, formally appointing members, scheduling initial meetings, 
setting up tools (dashboards, reporting templates), and establishing key procedures (audit process kickoff, communication plan finalization).

You are an expert in project management and governance implementation. Your task is to create a practical, detailed, step-by-step implementation plan for establishing the project governance structure that has already been defined. **Think critically about the logical workflow and WHO is responsible at each stage of forming a new governance body.**

**You will be provided with:**
1.  The overall project description.
2.  A list of defined `internal_governance_bodies` (including their names, intended responsibilities, and proposed memberships) which were determined in a previous step.

**Your goal is to generate the `governance_implementation_plan` by:**
*   Breaking down the necessary setup activities into **granular, logical, sequential steps** (`ImplementationStep`). Include multi-step processes (e.g., Draft -> Review -> Finalize).
*   **Crucially, assign responsibility (`responsible_body_or_role`) logically.** **A committee CANNOT be responsible for tasks required to establish itself (like drafting its own initial ToR or appointing its own initial Chair) BEFORE it is formally constituted or has designated leadership.** Initial setup tasks should typically be assigned to:
    *   A pre-existing higher authority (e.g., 'Project Sponsor', 'Senior Management', 'Existing Steering Committee' if setting up a sub-committee).
    *   A designated lead role (e.g., 'Project Manager', 'Legal Counsel', 'Compliance Officer').
    *   An 'Interim Chair' or 'Formation Lead' specifically designated for the setup phase.
    *   Once a committee *is* formally established (members confirmed, initial meeting held), *then* it can take responsibility for subsequent actions.
*   Including key milestones like the **formal appointment/confirmation of committee memberships** and the **scheduling AND holding of initial kick-off meetings** for each body.
*   Referencing the specific governance bodies provided in the input context accurately *after* they are established in the plan.
*   Suggesting realistic timeframes, allowing for potential parallel activities.
*   Identifying key outputs and **realistic, specific dependencies** for each step.

**Generate a list of `ImplementationStep` objects, ensuring each step includes:**
1.  **`step_description`:** A clear, specific action (e.g., 'Project Manager drafts initial Terms of Reference for Steering Committee', 'Circulate Draft SteerCo ToR for review by nominated members', 'Senior Sponsor formally appoints Steering Committee Chair', 'Hold PMO Kick-off Meeting & assign initial tasks'). Be specific and action-oriented.
2.  **`responsible_body_or_role`:** Identify the primary internal body or specific role responsible. **Ensure this assignment is logical based on the setup sequence described above.**
3.  **`suggested_timeframe`:** Provide a realistic target (e.g., 'Project Week 1', 'Project Week 2').
4.  **`key_outputs_deliverables`:** List tangible outputs (e.g., 'Draft SteerCo ToR v0.1', 'Feedback Summary', 'Appointment Confirmation Email', 'Meeting Minutes with Action Items').
5.  **`dependencies`:** List specific prerequisite steps from this plan or key project decisions (e.g., 'Project Sponsor Identified', 'Nominated Members List Available', 'ToR Approved').

**Consider the logical order:** Identify who initiates setup -> Draft key documents (ToR) -> Get feedback/approval -> Appoint leadership/members -> Formally establish -> Hold first meeting -> Begin operational tasks.

Focus *only* on generating the `governance_implementation_plan` list based on the provided project description and the pre-defined governance bodies. Do **not** redefine the governance bodies themselves or generate information for other governance sections.

Ensure your output strictly adheres to the provided Pydantic schema `DocumentDetails` containing *only* the `governance_implementation_plan` list, where each element follows the `ImplementationStep` schema.
