# Technical Task List: Coffee Making Application

Build an application that helps users make coffee by tracking their preferences and guiding them through the process.

**Total Tasks:** 5

---

## Task 1: Define User Profile Data Model

**ID:** task-001

**Priority:** High

**Estimated Effort:** Small

**Tags:** data-model, backend

### Description

Create a data structure to store user information and coffee preferences. This should include user identification, their preferred coffee types, brewing methods, and customization options like milk type and sugar levels. The data model should be flexible enough to accommodate future additions without requiring major restructuring.

### Acceptance Criteria

1. User profiles can store unique identifiers, names, and email addresses
2. Coffee preferences include coffee type, strength, milk options, and sugar amount
3. Data validation ensures all required fields are present
4. The model supports CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete)
5. Default preferences can be set for new users

### Examples

#### Example User Profile

A user profile might include: username "coffee_lover_123", email "user@example.com", preferred coffee type "espresso", strength "medium", milk preference "oat milk", and sugar level "1 teaspoon".

#### Profile Validation

When creating a profile with missing required fields (e.g., no email address), the system should reject the input and provide clear error messages indicating which fields are required.

## Task 2: Implement Coffee Recipe Logic

**ID:** task-002

**Priority:** High

**Estimated Effort:** Medium

**Tags:** business-logic, backend

**Dependencies:**
- Task task-001

### Description

Build the core logic that determines the correct coffee recipe based on user preferences. This includes calculating ingredient quantities, determining brewing parameters (temperature, time), and generating step-by-step instructions. The logic should handle various coffee types (espresso, drip, french press, etc.) and adjust recipes based on user customization.

### Acceptance Criteria

1. Recipes generate correct ingredient quantities based on serving size
2. Brewing parameters (temperature, time) are calculated for each coffee type
3. Step-by-step instructions are generated in logical order
4. User preferences are correctly applied to the base recipe
5. Edge cases (missing ingredients, conflicting preferences) are handled gracefully

### Examples

#### Espresso Recipe Generation

For a user requesting 2 espresso shots with oat milk: Calculate 14g coffee per shot (28g total), water temperature 93Â°C, extraction time 25-30 seconds, and 100ml steamed oat milk.

#### Preference Adjustment

If a user prefers "strong" coffee, increase the coffee-to-water ratio by 20% compared to the standard recipe. If they prefer "weak", decrease by 20%.

## Task 3: Create Coffee Preparation API

**ID:** task-003

**Priority:** High

**Estimated Effort:** Medium

**Tags:** api, backend

**Dependencies:**
- Task task-002

### Description

Design and implement API endpoints that allow clients to request coffee recipes, save user preferences, and retrieve preparation history. The API should follow RESTful principles, provide clear response formats, and include proper error handling. Endpoints should support filtering and pagination where appropriate.

### Acceptance Criteria

1. GET endpoint retrieves user preferences and returns formatted JSON
2. POST endpoint creates new coffee orders with validated input
3. PUT endpoint updates existing user preferences
4. DELETE endpoint removes user data with proper authorization
5. All endpoints return appropriate HTTP status codes (200, 201, 400, 404, etc.)
6. API responses include clear error messages for invalid requests

### Examples

#### GET Request for Recipe

Request: `GET /api/coffee/recipe?userId=123&coffeeType=espresso`
Response: JSON object containing ingredients, quantities, brewing parameters, and instructions.

#### POST Request to Create Order

Request: `POST /api/coffee/order` with body containing user ID, coffee type, and customizations.
Response: 201 Created with order ID and estimated preparation time.

### Notes

Consider rate limiting to prevent abuse. Implement authentication to protect user-specific endpoints. Document all endpoints with examples.

## Task 4: Build User Interface for Coffee Selection

**ID:** task-004

**Priority:** Medium

**Estimated Effort:** Large

**Tags:** ui, frontend

**Dependencies:**
- Task task-003

### Description

Create an intuitive user interface that allows users to select their coffee type, customize preferences, and view preparation instructions. The interface should be responsive, accessible, and provide real-time feedback as users make selections. Include visual elements like coffee type images and interactive controls for customization options.

### Acceptance Criteria

1. Users can browse available coffee types with visual representations
2. Preference controls (sliders, dropdowns) update in real-time
3. The interface is responsive and works on mobile, tablet, and desktop
4. Preparation instructions are displayed clearly with step-by-step guidance
5. Form validation provides immediate feedback on invalid inputs
6. The UI follows accessibility guidelines (WCAG 2.1 Level AA)

### Examples

#### Coffee Type Selection

Display a grid of coffee types (espresso, latte, cappuccino, americano) with images. When a user clicks on a type, highlight the selection and show available customization options.

#### Preference Customization

Provide sliders for strength adjustment (weak to strong), dropdowns for milk type selection (none, whole, skim, oat, almond), and numeric input for sugar amount (0-3 teaspoons).

### Notes

Use progressive enhancement to ensure basic functionality works without JavaScript. Consider adding animations for smoother user experience. Test with screen readers for accessibility.

## Task 5: Add Preparation History Tracking

**ID:** task-005

**Priority:** Low

**Estimated Effort:** Small

**Tags:** feature, backend, frontend

**Dependencies:**
- Task task-003
- Task task-004

### Description

Implement functionality to track and display users' coffee preparation history. Store each order with timestamp, coffee type, customizations, and user feedback (optional ratings). Provide interface elements to view past orders and quickly reorder favorite coffees. This feature helps users discover their preferences over time.

### Acceptance Criteria

1. Each coffee order is saved with complete details and timestamp
2. Users can view their preparation history in chronological order
3. History can be filtered by date range and coffee type
4. Users can quickly reorder from history with one click
5. Optional rating system allows users to mark favorite preparations
6. History includes pagination for users with many orders

### Examples

#### Viewing History

Display a list of past coffee orders showing: date/time, coffee type, customizations (e.g., "Latte with oat milk, medium strength, 1 sugar"), and optional star rating.

#### Quick Reorder

Each history item includes a "Make Again" button that pre-fills all customization options from that order, allowing users to quickly recreate their favorite coffee.

### Notes

Consider data retention policies - how long should history be kept? Implement soft deletion so users can "hide" orders without permanently removing data. Add export functionality for users who want their data.
