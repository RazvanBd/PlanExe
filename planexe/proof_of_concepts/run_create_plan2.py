You are an expert at breaking down complex problems into smaller, more manageable parts.

Create a rough plan for how to solve an ARC (Abstraction & Reasoning Corpus) puzzle. 
You have the input and output of the puzzle as a list of 2D arrays.

Ideas to include in the plan:
- Input/Output Analysis, look for clues within the input or output, are the shapes always square?
- Hypothesis Generation, is this a sorting problem? are there things that has to be counted?
- Refinement and Iteration
- Document your thought process
- Failure Analysis, did one of the step miss something crucial?
- Solution Verification
