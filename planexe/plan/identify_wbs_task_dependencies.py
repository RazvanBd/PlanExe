"""
Identified dependencies, that serves as a foundation for task sequencing.
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Work_breakdown_structure

IDEA: I'm not happy about have two separate arrays for the task_ids and the explanations.
There should be 1 task id and 1 explanation per dependency.
Currently there can be N task ids and M explanations, where N != M. This is not good.

IDEA: Label each dependency with its type (FS, SS, FF, SF).
- Finish-to-Start (FS): Task B cannot start until Task A is finished (most common).
- Start-to-Start (SS): Task B cannot start until Task A starts.
- Finish-to-Finish (FF): Task B cannot finish until Task A is finished.
- Start-to-Finish (SF): Task B cannot finish until Task A starts (least common).

IDEA: Missing Dependencies.
I asked Gemini to check the json file containing the dependencies, and it did spot some missing dependencies.
So I need an extra LLM that can go identify if there are more missing dependencies.

Find the 10 most critical important task dependencies. Don't attempt making an exhaustive list.

Understanding how tasks relate to each other is crucial for accurate timeline planning. 
Dependencies determine the sequence in which tasks must be completed.

Types of Dependencies:
    •	Finish-to-Start (FS): Task B cannot start until Task A is finished.
    •	Start-to-Start (SS): Task B cannot start until Task A starts.
    •	Finish-to-Finish (FF): Task B cannot finish until Task A finishes.
    •	Start-to-Finish (SF): Task B cannot finish until Task A starts (rarely used).

Example Dependencies:
    •	Land Acquisition must be completed before Permitting and Approvals can begin.
    •	Permitting and Approvals must be completed before Design and Engineering starts.
    •	Procurement of materials can begin once Design and Engineering is underway.
